Build full rows by fitting the falling tiles together.

Full rows are demolished and points are awarded. Multiple rows demolished earn you more points.

Each demolished row awards you with a bouncing ball. Hit the ball with a tile to collect a bonus.

Do not let the tiles pile too high! If you reach the top you lose.

Green - Score bonus

STRATEGY
========

Don't go for a hiscore too early in the game. Focus on getting the good extras. You need them in the later levels!

Try to get slow-downs as early as possible.

Careful when playing with HIGH BALLs. You gain many extras but beware of the DEATH ROW.

Try to build same colored lines and learn about the extras spawned.
